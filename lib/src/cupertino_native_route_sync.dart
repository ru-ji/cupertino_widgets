/// ## Why a bridge instead of real Navigator support
///
/// A scaffold body runs in its **own FlutterEngine**, so it is a separate
/// isolate with separate memory. A `GoRouter` (or any `Navigator`) built in
/// the host engine simply does not exist inside a body — there is no object to
/// share and no `BuildContext` that spans the two. Navigation between scaffold
/// pages therefore happens on the *native* stack, and the app's router is
/// mirrored onto it.
///
/// That mirroring is what this file provides. The router stays the single
/// source of truth; the native stack follows it, and native-initiated changes
/// (the back button, the back-swipe) are reported back so the router can catch
/// up.
